# Help wanted


First, be aware any work you do that is checked into ulysses_splits
github archive is CC0 -- anything you check in to the repository must
be clear of copyright (in particular, no plagarizing from Gifford),
and you grant anyone the right to reuse, adapt, change your work
wihout acknowledgement or attribution.

## How to

If you're familiar with GitHub, you can make contributions on your pc
and get them incorporated via pull request.  Otherwise contact
me thru: gmail -- gusearthsapho ; or reddit -- earthsaphogus --
or twitter -- upup1904


## Content help

1. Mark up .md files for first episodes (thru lestrygonians) with
where they break in Delaney's podcast

1. Make lists of vocabulary at the UPUP-file level

1. Get citations for slang, irish, latin at the UPUP file level.  (Gifford
includes many definitions but they typically give no source and
often are debatable; a digital format doesn't have be so concise.)

1. Get links to scholarly resources, e.g. from Jstor, and the
UPUP files they correspond to.

1. Get the keywords for page numbers in the 1888 Skeat Etymology
(extend this file: https://github.com/upup1904/ulysses_splits/blob/master/skeat/skeat_marks.md)

1. On split out chunks, collect the Gabler line numbers for episodes
thru Scylla.


## programmer

1. Make a web utility that allows non-GitHub users to contribute word
definitions, titles, etc.

2. For links to  non-password protected content, detect if they are
up-to-date in archive.org; detect dead-links and provide archive.org link
when available.

3.  Improvements to reddit posting script: 

a. add rotating "Here's this week's..." text
b. Have it stop and prompt if no title available, or grab first few words

## Co-project owner

If you're interested in helping to guide the project, get in touch.
I'm too old to "finish" it, and hope a group of younger people can
keep adding to it.
