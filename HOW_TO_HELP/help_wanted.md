where they break in Delaney's podcast

UPUP files they correspond to.

## programmer

1. Utility to add a link to multiple UPUP_links, e.g.

add link ./linkfile.txt 12.1 12.5-8 14.14-15

would add any links in the named file to the UPUP_*links.txt file for
UPUPs 12.1, 12.5, 12.6, etc.

2. For links to  non-password protected content, detect if they are
up-to-date in archive.org; detect dead-links and provide archive.org link
when available.
