On github website, you fork the repository
(https://github.com/upup1904/ulysses_splits).

Clone your forked copy onto your computer.

Then, on your pc, in your cloned copy you made from you fork, make the a new
diretory for the episode, and split files in
ulysses_splits/epispode_name.

Using any technology you want (more detail below), break the thing
into .md files (can just do a few or all at once), then commit/push as
usual.  

Now you've got a repo on github which started life as a copy of mine,
but your copy has changes I want, so you do a pull request, and that's
done on the github website.  A 'pull request' means you're asking me
to pull the changes in your copy into the upup1904 repository.

The steps are:

----- "using whatever technology you want" -------------

I copy-pasted the whole gutenberg novel from into a text editor, and
lost all the formatting.  During the course of writing to you, I saw
there are lots of html-to-markdown options, you might want to look at
that. 

I trimmed the file down to just the Cyclops episode, then I went thru
and put a token at the beginning of lines where I wanted the splits,
and I wrote a script to break it into files for me.  I added the page numbers
from the copy mentioned below as a went, I didn't think of any clever
way to do it.  The just add/commit/push.  I'm still working thru getting
the formatting right, and in the later splits I have some that are much
too long, so the numbering will change a bit.

For the numbers in the filenames, you can call it anything like,
episode01.md, episode02.md, etc.  Once I have the numbering finished
for Cyclops, it's easy to change their name to be like the ones I did
already.

For a guideline of how much to do per split -- approx 1 page per file,
judging page by this copy:

It's best to get it on some natural split.  Sometimes that's hard.

I found it easiest to go thru the text file, make a mark in the text where
I wanted to split it, then I wrote a script that created files from the
marks.  

The script is in the repository; if you have python installed it
might be helpful, it's looking for marks like "* [UPUP #25]" and making
them into files with the names you see in the repo.
