UPUP is a split of Joyce's Ulysses originally made use in the reddit
jamesjoyce sub.  It can be used for anything; the work is CC0, meaning
you can use it/change it without attribution.

Each "chunk" is about a page long, and there is an .md file or each.
(.md is for markdown, which is a convenient-to-type format supported
by many web sites, such as a reddit and github).

The beginning of each file has links for various sites.  If you want
to add something, go ahead and submit it as a pull request.

UPUP #1 started where Frank Delaney's podcasts left off.  One of the
big "help-wanted" items for the UPUP project is splitting up the parts
from before #1 (middle of wandering rocks) and making UPUP #0, UPUP -1,
etc.

If you are typing markdown, the most subtle thing to know is that to
get single-spaced lines, e.g., lines of poetry, you need to put two or
more spaces as the end of a line.
