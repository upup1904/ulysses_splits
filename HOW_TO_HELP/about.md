## About UPUP

UPUP is a group read-thru of Ulysses in years-long cycle. It runs
on Reddit.  The split out episodes are (very roughly) 1 page of the
egoist edition.  (Egoist is convenient because it's open to all
at openlibrary.org)

## About Reddit

Reddit is just a so-so platform, technically, for this kind of thing.
The main drawback it has is that posts more than a couple days old are
buried by its UI, so if you comment on a non-current post, its
unlikely anyone except the one person to whom you respond will see it.

Culturally, it doesn't seem the ownership has any commitment to
openness.  Reddit has a history of sexist/cyberstalker culture that
keeps a lot of people away from the platform.  But I don't know a more
practical alternative to reddit.  It would be iteresting if someone
would explore a reddit-email gateway.
