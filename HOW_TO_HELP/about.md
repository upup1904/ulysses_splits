## About UPUP

There are two UPUPs: UPUP on reddit and UPUP on Github.  **UPUP on
reddit** is a series of posts, approximately every four days, each
having approximately one page of Ulysses.  **UPUP on Github** is an
open ended project to collect freely reusable material related to
Ulysses.  It is organized around passages from the the novel , each
roughly a page as printed in the 1922 edition (more in Circe, less in
Penelope).  The first 368 parts (thru the middle of Wandering Rocks)
use the divisions of Frank Delaney's "re Joye" podcasts.

As of December 2019, the project is still embryonic an suggestions on how
it should develop are welcome.  Some thoughts of mine
(/u/Earthsophagus on reddit):

### Current features

episodes split into chunks, with Gabler line numbers and Egoist page
numbers.  Currently Scylla-NaussicaaCyclops are complete.

Links to episode-wide blog posts, modernism lab, Digital archive.

### Envisioned features

+ per-chunk links to scholarly resoures (e.g.  from Jstor, Academia,
MUSE) and bibliographical citatations to printed matter.

+ links to relevant podcasts

+ unobtrusive mark for Gabler line ends

+ page numbers from other editions, Viking, Alma

+ vocabulary and etymology notes per page

+ freely reusable (CC0) commentary

## UPUP on Reddit

UPUP is also the name of a group read-thru of Ulysses in years-long
cycle. It runs on Reddit.

Reddit is just a so-so platform, technically, for this kind of thing.
Reddit is designed to discuss trending topics, not to sustain
discussion of minute facets of century-old novels with permanent
interest.  The main drawback it has is that posts more than a couple
days old are buried by its UI, and so if you comment on a non-current
post, it's unlikely anyone except the one person to whom you respond
will see it.

Culturally, the ownership of Reddit doesn't have any commitment to
openness/stability.  Reddit has a history of sexist/cyberstalker culture that
keeps a lot of people away from the platform.  But I don't know a more
practical alternative to reddit.  It would be iteresting if someone
would explore a reddit-email gateway.

Its advantage is that it's easy to post to, there's no practial
limitation to how much anyone can post, and that anyone can read it
whether they have an account or not, and it's "discoverable."
