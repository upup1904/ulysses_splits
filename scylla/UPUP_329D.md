delaney329 Buttocks & Beggars

Unsheathe your dagger definitions. Horseness is the whatness of
allhorse. Streams of tendency and eons they worship. God: noise in the
street: very peripatetic. Space: what you damn well have to see. Through
spaces smaller than red globules of man’s blood they creepycrawl after
Blake’s buttocks into eternity of which this vegetable world is but a
shadow. Hold to the now, the here, through which all future plunges to
the past.

Mr Best came forward, amiable, towards his colleague.

—Haines is gone, he said.

—Is he?

—I was showing him Jubainville’s book. He’s quite enthusiastic, don’t
you know, about Hyde’s *Lovesongs of Connacht.* I couldn’t bring him in
to hear the discussion. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy it.

	Bound thee forth, my booklet, quick
	To greet the callous public. 
	Writ, I ween, ’twas not my wish
	In lean unlovely English.

—The peatsmoke is going to his head, John Eglinton opined.

We feel in England. Penitent thief. Gone. I smoked his baccy. Green
twinkling stone. An emerald set in the ring of the sea.

—People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of
Russell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the
world are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant’s heart on the
hillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the living
mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the
sixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest flower
of corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the
poor of heart, the life of Homer’s Phæacians.

From these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.

—Mallarmé, don’t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose
poems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about
*Hamlet.* He says: *il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même*, don’t
you know, *reading the book of himself*. He describes *Hamlet* given in
a French town, don’t you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.

His free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Hamlet</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">ou</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Le Distrait</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Pièce de Shakespeare</i></p>

He repeated to John Eglinton’s newgathered frown:

—*Pièce de Shakespeare*, don’t you know. It’s so French. The French
point of view. *Hamlet ou*...

—The absentminded beggar, Stephen ended.
