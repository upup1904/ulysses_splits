And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that
that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were
the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was
very *petite* but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five,
and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one
smart buckle over her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle
displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the
proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun
hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops. As for undies they
were Gerty's chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and
fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen
again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets
with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and
each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue,
mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when
they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to
keep the iron on because she wouldn't trust those washerwomen as far
as she'd see them scorching the things.  She was wearing the blue for
luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to
have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that
day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for
the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might
be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped
up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers'
meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied
that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn't of a Friday.

And yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is
there all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give
worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving
way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings
though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the
mirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls
upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.
Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage
has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T. C.
D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie)
and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a
sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to
be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in love, a
woman's birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer's (he was
still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round
her waist she went white to the very lips. He called her little one in a
strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was
only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a
remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had
never been Reggy Wylie's strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty
MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always waiting to be
asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. No prince
charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet
but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his
ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would
understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all
the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long
long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she yearns this balmy
summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his
affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death
us two part, from this to this day forward.
