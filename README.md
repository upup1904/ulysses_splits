# ulysses_splits

Ulysses by Joyce split up into chunks

## Purpose

To facilitate any "serialization" project of Ulysses.  It comes out of
the UPUP series on https://reddit.com/r/jamesjoyce, where a little bit of the
novel is discussed on a periodic schedule.  See [about UPUP](about.md) for
more detail.

## Contributing

## Why markdown?

.md files are used by numerous websites to generate HTML, notably
reddit and github.  They are easy to prepare on PCs/macs, the most
pratical technology for working on text docs as of 2019 (one imagines
5-10 years from now smartphone-like devices will make text editors
seem fusty/quaint).


## Why github?

It's a compromise but in 2019 a pretty obvious choice.  Github
provides merge/shared admin/transparency unrivaled right now.  It's
uncomfortably technical ("Lean unlovely english") for a lot of us, but
anyone who wants to contribute should be able to find a way.

## Sources

The text is from Gutenberg.org.  Gabler line numbers and links to web
resources are added by volunteers.  The bibliography is created by
volunteers.
