Prompts:

o) why "goodlooking sovereign"  
o) Bloom is repeatedly likened to cod; why; what does citizen mean?

o) what does the citizen mean by "my brown son"

So anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the
sight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid. O, as true
as I’m telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.

—And there’s more where that came from, says he.

—Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.

—Sweat of my brow, says Joe. ’Twas the prudent member gave me the wheeze.

—I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and
Greek street with his cod’s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.

Who comes through Michan’s land, bedight in sable armour? O’Bloom, the
son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory’s son: he of the
prudent soul.

—For the old woman of Prince’s street, says the citizen, the
subsidised organ. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And
look at this blasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. *The Irish
Independent*, if you please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman’s
friend. Listen to the births and deaths in the *Irish all for Ireland
Independent*, and I’ll thank you and the marriages.

And he starts reading them out:

—Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne’s
on Sea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How’s that, eh?
Wright and Flint, Vincent and Gillett to Rotha Marion daughter of Rosa
and the late George Alfred Gillett, 179 Clapham road, Stockwell,
Playwood and Ridsdale at Saint Jude’s, Kensington by the very reverend
Dr Forrest, dean of Worcester. Eh? Deaths. Bristow, at Whitehall lane,
London: Carr, Stoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease:
Cockburn, at the Moat house, Chepstow...

—I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.

—Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty:
Miller, Tottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning
street, Liverpool, Isabella Helen. How’s that for a national press,
eh, my brown son! How’s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?

—Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they
had the start of us. Drink that, citizen.

—I will, says he, honourable person.

—Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.

Ah! Ow! Don’t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that
pint. Declare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a
click.
