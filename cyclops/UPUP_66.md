So off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of
lawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the
soil and building up a nation once again and all to that. And of
course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s
heart violent exercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you
took up a straw from the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: *Look
at, Bloom. Do you see that straw? That’s a straw.* Declare to my aunt
he’d talk about it for an hour so he would and talk steady.

A most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of *Brian
O’Ciarnain’s* in *Sraid na Bretaine Bheag*, under the auspices of *Sluagh
na h-Eireann*, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the
importance of physical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and
ancient Rome and ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The
venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the
attendance was of large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by
the chairman, a magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed,
a most interesting and instructive discussion of the usual high
standard of excellence ensued as to the desirability of the
revivability of the ancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic
forefathers. The wellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of
our old tongue, Mr Joseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for
the resuscitation of the ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised
morning and evening by Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best
traditions of manly strength and prowess handed down to us from
ancient ages. L. Bloom, who met with a mixed reception of applause and
hisses, having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the
discussion to a close, in response to repeated requests and hearty
plaudits from all parts of a bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy
rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses
(happily too familiar to need recalling here) A nation once again in
the execution of which the veteran patriot champion may be said
without fear of contradiction to have fairly excelled himself. The
Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian
notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem
sung as only our citizen can sing it. His superb highclass vocalism,
which by its superquality greatly enhanced his already international
reputation, was vociferously applauded by the large audience among
which were to be noticed many prominent members of the clergy as well
as representatives of the press and the bar and the other learned
professions. The proceedings then terminated.

Amongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J.,
L. L. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh,
C. S. Sp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.;
