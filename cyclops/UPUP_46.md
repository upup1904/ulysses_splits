The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was
that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired
freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded
deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed
hero. From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his
rocklike mountainous knees were covered, as was likewise the rest of
his body wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair
in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (*Ulex
Europeus*). The widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same
tawny hue projected, were of such capaciousness that within their
cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her
nest. The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery
were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current
of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of
his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale
reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing
the ground, the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls
of the cave to vibrate and tremble.

He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to
the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a
girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of
deerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were
encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet
being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of
the same beast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled
at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven
with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and
heroines of antiquity, Cuchulin, Conn of hundred battles, Niall of
nine hostages, Brian of Kincora, the ardri Malachi, Art MacMurragh,
Shane O’Neill, Father John Murphy, Owen Roe, Patrick Sarsfield, Red

Buddha, Lady Godiva, The Lily of Killarney, Balor of the Evil Eye, the
Queen of Sheba, Acky Nagle, Joe Nagle, Alessandro Volta, Jeremiah
O’Donovan Rossa, Don Philip O’Sullivan Beare. A couched spear of
acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage
animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he
was sunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls
and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time
by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of
paleolithic stone.
