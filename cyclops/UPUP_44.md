Titles:

1. The bounty of Ireland and a Cornucopia of Containers
2. An exaltation of veg
3. [UPUP #44] Ireland's bounty: Ornaments of the arboreal world; polly bullocks; a hill and dale robber

Prompts:

o) the second paragraph lists many unfamiliar containers - chips, punnets, flaskets -- are types of boxes, baskets and barrells.  Is JJ drawing attention to containers for anything beyond the fun of making a list?

o) what's the point of the abrupt break in the narrative of the gus
heading for Kiernan's, and why the short paragraph of his thoughts coming
back in the middle of this section?

In Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There
rises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as
in life they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant
land it is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport
the gurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock,
the grilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed
coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too
numerous to be enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the
east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass
foliage, the wafty sycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted
planetree, the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal
world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely
maidens sit in close proximity to the roots of the lovely trees
singing the most lovely songs while they play with all kinds of lovely
objects as for example golden ingots, silvery fishes, crans of
herrings, drafts of eels, codlings, creels of fingerlings, purple
seagems and playful insects. And heroes voyage from afar to woo them,
from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless princes of unfettered Munster
and of Connacht the just and of smooth sleek Leinster and of
Cruachan’s land and of Armagh the splendid and of the noble district
of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.

And there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen
by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly
for that purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and
firstfruits of that land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a
chieftain descended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains
bring foison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of
spinach, pineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums
of figs, drills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of
iridescent kale, York and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the
earth, and punnets of mushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches
and bere and rape and red green yellow brown russet sweet big bitter
ripe pomellated apples and chips of strawberries and sieves of
gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious, and strawberries fit for princes
and raspberries from their canes.

I dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty,
you notorious bloody hill and dale robber!

And by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed
ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers
and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and
Cuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the
various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus
heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime
premiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,
cackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,
champing, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from
pasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy
vales of Thomond, from the M’Gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and
lordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of
the place of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with
superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and
farmer’s firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong
eggs in great hundreds, various in size, the agate with this dun.
